# piTV

[![ios app on the App store](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shandoosheri/piTV/master/pitv/images/appstore.jpg)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pitv-remote/id1132014654?ls=1&mt=8)

piTV gives your raspberry pi functionallities similar to that of a chromecast. 
It sure lacks some of the chromecast's functionalites but it gives the option to setup a pin to control it 

The ios app enables you to send video links from most apps as well as offer simple media controlling options


This software isn't perfect and is not built for security what so ever all text and pin is transferred and stored in plain text.

i have tested this on a raspberry pi 3 running rasbian jessie

to install simply run

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shandoosheri/piTV/master/setup.sh && sudo sh setup.sh`
