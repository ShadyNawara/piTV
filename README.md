# piTV
piTV gives your raspberry pi functionallities similar to that of a chromecast. 
It sure lacks some of the chromecast's functionalites but it gives the option to setup a pin to control it 

The ios app enables you to send video links from most apps as well as offer simple media controlling options


This software isn't perfect and is not built for security what so ever all text and pin is transfered and stored in plain text.
